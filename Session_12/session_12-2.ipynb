    "## Origins of Graph Theory\n",
    "Before we start with the actual implementations of graphs in Python and before we start with the introduction of Python modules dealing with graphs, we want to devote ourselves to the origins of graph theory.\n",
    "The origins take us back in time to the Künigsberg of the 18th century. Königsberg was a city in Prussia that time. The river Pregel flowed through the town, creating two islands. The city and the islands were connected by seven bridges as shown. The inhabitants of the city were moved by the question if it was possible to take a walk through the town by visiting each area of the town and crossing each bridge only once. Every bridge must have been crossed completely, i.e., it is not allowed to walk halfway onto a bridge and then turn around and later cross the other half from the other side. The walk needs not start and end at the same spot. Leonhard Euler solved the problem in 1735 by proving that it is not possible. He found out that the choice of a route inside each land area is irrelevant and that the only thing which mattered is the order (or the sequence) in which the bridges are crossed. He had formulated an abstraction of the problem, eliminating unnecessary facts and focusing on the land areas and the bridges connecting them. This way, he created the foundations of graph theory. If we see a \"land area\" as a vertex and each bridge as an edge, we have \"reduced\" the problem to a graph.\n",

    "<img src=simple_graph_isolated.png>\n",
    "Before we start our treatize on possible Python representations of graphs, we want to present some general definitions of graphs and its components.\n",
    "A \"graph\" in mathematics and computer science consists of \"nodes\", also known as \"vertices\". Nodes may or may not be connected with one another. In our illustration, - which is a pictorial representation of a graph, - the node \"a\" is connected with the node \"c\", but \"a\" is not connected with \"b\". The connecting line between two nodes is called an edge. If the edges between the nodes are undirected, the graph is called an undirected graph. If an edge is directed from one vertex (node) to another, a graph is called a directed graph. An directed edge is called an arc.\n",
    "Though graphs may look very theoretical, many practical problems can be represented by graphs. They are often used to model problems or situations in physics, biology, psychology and above all in computer science. In computer science, graphs are used to represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation.\n",
    "In the latter case, the are used to represent the data organisation, like the file system of an operating system, or communication networks. The link structure of websites can be seen as a graph as well, i.e., a directed graph, because a link is a directed edge or an arc.\n",
    "Python has no built-in data type or class for graphs, but it is easy to implement them in Python. One data type is ideal for representing graphs in Python, i.e., dictionaries. The graph in our illustration can be implemented in the following way: "
